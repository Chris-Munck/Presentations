                <p>The Hulk is a fictional character, a superhero in the Marvel Comics Universe. 
                Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The Incredible 
                Hulk #1 (May 1962).</p>
                
                <p>Hulk is cast as the emotional and impulsive alter ego of the withdrawn and 
                reserved physicist Dr. Bruce Banner. The Hulk appears shortly after Banner is 
                accidentally exposed to the blast of a test detonation of a gamma bomb he invented. 
                Subsequently, Banner will involuntarily transform into the Hulk, depicted as a 
                giant, raging, humanoid monster, leading to extreme complications in Banner's life. 
                Lee said the Hulk's creation was inspired by a combination of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. 
                Hyde and Frankenstein.</p>

                    <h2>Concept and creation</h2>

                    <p>The Hulk first appeared in The Incredible Hulk #1 (May 1962), written by 
                    writer-editor Stan Lee, and penciller and co-plotter Jack Kirby, and inked by 
                    Paul Reinman. Lee cites influence from Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. 
                    Hyde in the Hulk's creation:</p>

                    <blockquote>"I combined Jekyll and Hyde with Frankenstein," he explains, "and 
                    I got myself the monster I wanted, who was really good, but nobody knew it. 
                    He was also somebody who could change from a normal man into a monster, and 
                    lo, a legend was born." Lee remembers, "I had always loved the old movie 
                    Frankenstein. And it seemed to me that the monster, played by Boris Karloff, 
                    wasn't really a bad guy. He was the good guy. He didn't want to hurt anybody. 
                    It's just those idiots with torches kept running up and down the mountains, 
                    chasing him and getting him angry. And I thought, 'Wouldn't it be fun to 
                    create a monster and make him the good guy?'</blockquote>
                    
                    <p>Lee also compared Hulk to the Golem of Jewish myth. In The Science 
                    of Superheroes, Gresh and Weinberg see the Hulk as a reaction to the Cold 
                    War and the threat of nuclear attack, an interpretation shared by Weinstein 
                    in Up, Up and Oy Vey. Kaplan calls Hulk "schizophrenic." Jack Kirby 
                    has also commented upon his influences in drawing the character, recalling 
                    as inspiration the tale of a mother who rescues her child who is trapped 
                    beneath a car.</p>
